## ðŸ“‚ Project Location

`/Masterji Projects/02_JavaScript/Image Gallery with Lightbox Effect`

## ðŸŽ¨ Features

- A responsive image gallery grid showcasing multiple images.
- Lightbox overlay effect: clicking an image opens it in a centered overlay with background dimming.
- Close button or click outside overlay to exit lightbox.
- Smooth animations and transitions (hover effects, fade-in/out overlay).
- Simple, vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5 & CSS3 (no frameworks required).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nehal-Adil/Web-Dev-Cohort.git
   cd Web-Dev-Cohort/Masterji\ Projects/02_JavaScript/Image\ Gallery\ with\ Lightbox\ Effect

   ```

2. Open index.html in your browser (or serve via a static server for local testing).

3. Click on any image to open the lightbox; use the navigation or click outside/close to exit.

## Potential Enhancements

- Add keyboard navigation (left/right arrows in lightbox).

- Show image captions or titles beneath each image.

- Load images dynamically from an API or JSON list instead of static markup.

- Add zoom or fullscreen mode in lightbox.

- Enable lazy-loading of images for performance.

- Accessibility improvements: focus trap in lightbox, ARIA attributes.
